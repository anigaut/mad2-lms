This repository contains the source files for the MAD2 project of the IIT Madras BS program. It is an online library, where users can borrow, read and buy books, along with admin functionality to manage users, borrowings and so on. Reports on borrowing activity can be generated by admins and users are also sent periodic emails if they have a borrowed any books they haven't returned yet.
